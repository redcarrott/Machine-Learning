    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sklearn` documentation on feature extraction may be useful:\n",

    "- Make sure to answer every part in every question.\n",

    "---\n",
    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve generalization, it is common to try preprocessing text in various ways before splitting into words. For example, you could try transforming strings to lower case, replacing sequences of numbers with single tokens, removing various non-letter characters, and shortening long words.\n",

    "1. Produce a Logistic Regression model (with no preprocessing of text). **Note that you may need to override the \"default\" preprocessing with an identity function**. Evaluate and show its f1 score and size of the dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",

    " - Look at default pre-processing done.\n",
    " - Removing stop words.\n",
    " - Experiment with different ways of getting rid of apostrophe's such as replacing them with spaces or with empty strings.\n",
    "  - Lower casing.\n",
    "  - Including both lowercase and original case versions of a word.\n",
    "  - nltk functions such as stemming.\n",
    "* Train on the \"transformed\" training data, the data after you applied pre-processing.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data. Note that you never want to \"learn\" anything from the dev data.\n",
    "* You can use `CountVectorizer(preprocessor=...)` to preprocess strings with your own custom-defined function.\n",
    "* `CountVectorizer` default is to preprocess strings to lower case.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(C=0.5, solver=\"liblinear\", multi_class=\"auto\")` to produce a logistic regression model.\n",
    "* You can use `metrics.f1_score(..., average=\"weighted\")` to compute f1 score.\n",

    "### Question 6: L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
